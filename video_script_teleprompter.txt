Hero Lead Nurturing CRM — Teleprompter Script (humanized)
Estimated length: 5–8 minutes — read at a comfortable pace.

---

Opening (Friendly, natural)

Hi — welcome. Today I’m going to walk you through the Hero Lead Nurturing CRM.
I’ll explain the system layer by layer and point out the key files you can mention on camera.
I’ll also show the end‑to‑end flows you can demo.
Keep the delivery relaxed — short sentences, small pauses, and show the code or the running app when I cue you.

Quick setup mention (one line)

Run backend: `\.\mvnw.cmd -DskipTests spring-boot:run`
Run frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
Default credentials: `ho_admin / 1234` (Head Office) and `da_agent / 1234` (Dealer Agent).

---

Presentation layer — Frontend (what to say)

The frontend is a React app built with Vite. It’s responsible for the user interface, routing, and calling the backend APIs.
When you show files, keep each line short and explain only the purpose.

Files to name and one‑line use cases:
- `App.jsx` — the route map for public and protected pages.
- `Login.jsx` — login form and validation.
- `LeadList.jsx` — main lead table, filters and bulk actions.
- `LeadDetails.jsx` — detailed view for a single lead.
- `LeadCreate.jsx` — the create‑lead form.
- `Dashboard.jsx` — KPIs and charts for Head Office users.
- `ChatHistory.jsx` — lead‑scoped chat interface.
- `Layout.jsx`, `Header.jsx`, `Sidebar.jsx` — common layout components.
- `PrivateRoute.jsx` — protects pages based on role.

[PAUSE — show `LeadList.jsx` and `Dashboard.jsx` briefly]

---

Client API & state (short)

This layer standardizes HTTP calls and stores the logged‑in user.
Mention these files briefly:
- `apiClient.js` — Axios instance that adds the JWT token and handles 401s.
- `authService.js`, `leadService.js`, `chatService.js`, `dashboardService.js` — thin service wrappers for REST calls.
- `AuthContext.jsx` — stores user info and token in localStorage and exposes login/logout.

---

Backend — Controller (what it exposes)

The controllers form the API surface the frontend talks to.
Say the endpoint responsibility and move on.

Key files:
- `AuthController.java` — login, forgot/verify/reset password.
- `LeadController.java` — lead CRUD, filters and modification history.
- `DashboardController.java` — aggregated stats for charts.
- `ChatController.java` — send and read chat messages for a lead.
- `UploadController.java` — Excel file upload for bulk leads.

[ON SCREEN: Swagger or a quick curl showing `GET /api/leads`]

---

Backend — Service (business logic)

Services implement business rules and audits — these are where behavior lives.
Short file cues:
- `LeadService.java` — lead rules, audit entries and dashboard helpers.
- `DashboardService.java` — KPI calculations and source distribution.
- `ChatService.java` — chat persistence and retrieval.
- `FileUploadService.java` — parses Excel and creates leads.
- `PasswordResetService.java` — OTP generation and reset logic.

---

Persistence & domain model (one sentence)

JPA entities map to the database and repositories provide CRUD and queries.
Files to call out: `Lead`, `User`, `ChatMessage`, `LeadModification`, and the repositories like `LeadRepository` and `UserRepository`.

---

Security & configuration (speak plainly)

Security is JWT-based with role checks.
Tell the audience:
- `JwtUtil.java` generates and validates tokens (30‑minute expiry).
- `JwtAuthenticationFilter.java` authenticates every request using the token.
- `SecurityConfig.java` defines URL rules and CORS settings.
- Passwords are BCrypt-hashed in `PasswordConfig.java`.

[PAUSE — show `SecurityConfig.java` lines for a few seconds]

---

App bootstrap & utilities (very short)

`DataInitializer.java` seeds demo users and sample leads so the app is demo‑ready.
Mention helper scripts: `create_leads.ps1`, `upload_leads.ps1` and `test_endpoints.ps1`.

---

End‑to‑end flows — say these step‑by‑step

1) Login (what to say and show)
- Say: “User submits the login form.” Pause. “Frontend calls `authService.login()`.” Pause.
- Say: “Backend's `AuthController` authenticates and returns a JWT.” Show localStorage token briefly.

2) Load Lead List
- Say: “LeadList calls `leadService.getAllLeads()`.” Pause.
- Say: “Controller returns leads, UI renders the table and filters.” Show `LeadList.jsx` and the live table.

3) Create or update a lead (with audit)
- Say: “Creating a lead posts to `/api/leads`.” Pause. “Backend saves the lead and writes a `LeadModification` audit record.” Show the audit history in Lead Details.

4) Bulk upload
- Say: “Upload sends an Excel file to `/api/upload`.” Pause. “`FileUploadService` parses rows and creates leads in batch.” Show the upload modal and a quick success message.

5) Chat for a lead
- Say: “Chat UI posts messages to `/api/chat/{leadId}`.” Pause. “Messages are persisted and read back by `chatService.getChatHistory()`.” Open the Chat panel and send one test message.

6) Forgot / verify / reset password
- Say: “The forgot flow generates an OTP for demo, verify it, then call reset to update password (BCrypt).” Keep it short — show the screens.

7) Token expiry handling
- Say: “If the JWT expires, `apiClient` intercepts 401 responses, clears storage and redirects to login.” Show a simulated expired token scenario if needed.

---

Quick callouts — one‑liners you can read verbatim (pick a few)

- “`AuthController.java` handles login and password reset endpoints.”
- “`LeadController.java` is the main REST API for lead management.”
- “`LeadService.java` records audit history when a lead is changed.”
- “`apiClient.js` attaches the JWT to every request and handles 401s.”
- “`AuthContext.jsx` persists user session in localStorage.”

Closing (natural, friendly)

That’s the end of the walkthrough.
If you want, I can convert this into a timed teleprompter with exact timestamps, a shorter 2‑minute pitch, or a slide deck to match the script.

[ON SCREEN: show project root briefly — then fade to contact details or repo URL]

Read‑rate suggestion: keep sentences short, pause 1–2 seconds between flow steps, and 3 seconds before switching sections.

End of script.
